    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter, soft yet not greasy or mushy.</li>
        <li>Sugar (of course!).</li>
        <li>Cool/room temperature eggs.</li>
        <li>Real vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Flour.</li>
        <li>Baking powder.</li>
        <li>Salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> The first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer)
        until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes. Why do you cream butter and sugar
        in the first place? It's all about incorporating air into the mixture. The micro pockets of air you create by creaming cause the dough to rise
        as it bakes so your cookies will be light in texture instead of flat and dense. Cool (not cold) butter works best; butter that's too warm won't
        let you create the structure you need.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Add eggs and vanilla:</strong> After the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time. You'll
        want the eggs and vanilla to be thoroughly mixed into the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Add flour, baking powder, and salt:</strong> Measure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer
        to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl a couple of times so there are
        no streaks of flour in the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Cover and chill the dough:</strong> Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and
        helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Cut out your cookies with cookie cutters:</strong> Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you
        turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle. Dust your countertop
        and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into
        flour and cut out shapes. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. This space allows the dough
        to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Bake the cookies:</strong>  Good baking requires more than just popping something into the oven. For one thing, there's the temperature. Every oven heats
        differently. That's why we always recommend you use an oven thermometer to measure the real temperature before you start baking. And then there are the oven hot
        spots. To make sure your cookies (or any baked goods) bake evenly, its a good idea to rotate your pan halfway through the baking time.
        <br />
        These sugar cookies take only six to eight minutes to bake. You want them to be slightly browned around the edges but still light in color overall. Transfer
        them to a wire rack to cool completely; they'll firm up as they cool. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Decorate your delicious cookies as desired:</strong> You're now free to make the cookies look cute! Enjoy!
